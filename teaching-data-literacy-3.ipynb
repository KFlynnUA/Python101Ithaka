    "1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and choose \"Sign up\".\n",
    "2. Enter an email and password. (Note, you can skip the personalization questions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a test repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give your repository a name and leave it \"public.\"\n",
    "2. Choose \"creating a new file\" or \"README\" to create a file for your repository.\n",
    "3. Add some sample text and then choose \"Commit changes...\"\n",
    "4. Try making a second commit and then view the history of the repository. You can see the history by clicking on \"2 commits.\"\n",
    "5. Delete the repository by choosing \"Settings,\" then scroll all the way to the bottom. You may need to confirm several times before deleting a repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Choose the \"Settings\" menu.\n",

    "3. Choose \"Personal Access Tokens,\" then \"Tokens (classic),\" and finally \"Generate a personal access token.\"\n",
    "4. Create a note that helps you understand what the token is for, for example \"Constellate Lab Access.\" \n",
    "5. Choose how long you want the token to last. You can choose for the token to never expire.\n",
    "6. Click the repo flag, scroll to the bottom, and choose \"Generate token.\"\n",
    "7. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere secure, such as a password manager. For the short term, you could store it in a text document. Once you close the tab, you will not be able to see the token anymore! If you forget or lose the token, you should delete it in GitHub and generate a new token."
