    "The concordance has a long history in humanities study and Roberto Busa's concordance Index Thomisticus—started in 1946—is arguably the first digital humanities project. Before computers were common, they were printed in large volumes such as John Bartlett's 1982 reference book A Complete Concordance to Shakespeare—it was 1909 pages pages long! \n",
    "\n",
    "A concordance gives the context of a given word or phrase in a body of texts. For example, a literary scholar might ask: how often and in what context does Shakespeare use the phrase \"honest Iago\" in Othello? A historian might examine a particular politician's speeches, looking for examples of a particular \"dog whistle\".\n",
