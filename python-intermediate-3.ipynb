    "\n",
    "Python Intermediate 2 describes the way to open, read, and write files.

For example, `pathlib` can help you accomplish tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find whether a particular file or directory already exists\n",
    "* Simplify the code for reading and writing to files\n",
    "* Find information about a file, including its extension\n",

    "### The `pathlib` module improves on `os`: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python also includes an older module named `os` for working with filepaths. The `os` module is not deprecated, but most Python programmers will tell you to move to the newer module. The `os` module treats paths as strings which leads to a lot of issues, especially when working with different operating systems. `pathlib` has a much nicer syntax for things like joining paths, creating directories, stemming paths, finding parents, and iterating over files. Ultimately, many of the same tasks can be done with `os`, but the code is often longer and the syntax tends to be more difficult to read and write. If you are using someone else's code that contains `os` in it, it is worth learning `os` to understand the code. For most practical purposes, however, `pathlib` is superior and it is a good idea to write new code using `pathlib` instead of `os`."

      "hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\n",

      "nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\n",
      "had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\n",

      "existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\n",

      "hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\n",
      "seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\n",
      "what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\n",
      "time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\n",
      "excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\n",
      "snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\n",
      "the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\n",

      "them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\n",
      "deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\n",
      "grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\n",
      "pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\n",
      "the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\n",
      "mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\n",
      "the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\n",
      "we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\n",
      "peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\n",

      "\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God's seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\n",
      "us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\n",
      "emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\n",
      "sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\n",
      "we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\n",
      "that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\n",
      "and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\n",
      "was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\n",
      "turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\n",
      "devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\n",
      "many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\n",
      "and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\n",
      "shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\n",
      "again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\n",
      "long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\n",
      "road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\n",
      "peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\n",
      "coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\n",
      "staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\n",
      "and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\n",
      "gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\n",
      "ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\n",
      "Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\n",
      "late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\n",
      "that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\n",
      "greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\n",
      "peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\n",
      "grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\n",
      "threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\n",
      "Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\n",
      "hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\n",
      "only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\n",
      "but the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\n",
      "walk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\n",
      "evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\n",
      "approving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\n",
      "before you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\n",
      "pause to light his lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\n",
      "passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\n",
      "though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\n",
      "with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\n",
      "to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\n",
      "patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\n",
      "hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\n",
      "rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\n",
      "stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\n",
      "to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\n",
      "side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\n",
      "by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\n",
      "upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\n",
      "certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\n",
      "faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\n",
      "fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\n",
      "Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\n",
      "Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\n",
      "passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\n",
      "darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\n",
      "happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\n",
      "give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\n",
      "some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\n",
      "the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\n",
      "air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\n",
      "mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\n",
      "into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\n",
      "which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\n",
      "glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\n",
      "was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\n",
      "hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\n",
      "road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\n",
      "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\n",
      "my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\n",
      "the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\n",
      "could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\n",
      "thought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\n",
      "in German worse than my own:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\n",
      "now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\n",
      "the next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\n",
      "snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\n",
      "amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\n",
      "of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\n",
      "us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\n",
      "lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\n",
      "splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\n",
      "beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\n",
      "could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\n",
      "in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\n",
      "deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\n",
      "spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\n",
      "very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\n",
      "companions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\n",
      "    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\n",
      "gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\n",
      "putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\n",
      "luggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\n",
      "handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\n",
      "coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\n",
      "hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\n",
      "prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\n",
      "swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\n",
      "from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\n",
      "against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\n",
      "the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\n",
      "on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\n",
      "strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\n",
      "over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\n",
      "excellent German:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\n",
      "care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\n",
      "country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\n",
      "any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\n",
      "little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\n",
      "any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\n",
      "unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\n",
      "then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\n",
      "seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\n",
      "again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\n",
      "so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\n",
      "I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\n",
