    "# What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of ${\\bf classes}$ and ${\\bf objects}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is used to structure software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints called ${\\bf classes}$, which are used to create individual instances of ${\\bf classes}$ called ${\\bf objects}$. Python, the programming language we are using in the Constellate tutorials, is an object-oriented programming language. "

    "\n",
