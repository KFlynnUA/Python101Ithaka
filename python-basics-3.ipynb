    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used several [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) already, including `print()`, `input()`, and `range()`. You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses `()` where [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument) can be **passed** into the function. Depending on the [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) (and your goals for using it), a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) may accept no [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument), a single [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument), or many [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument). For example, when we use the `print()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function), a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) (or a variable containing a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string)) is passed as an [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more **modular**. We don't need to know all the details of how the `print()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) works in order to use it. [Functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument) into the box and a **return value** comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may *need* to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",

    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "While [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) comes with many [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function), there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) that do different things. The solution then is that [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) are stored in [modules](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module) that can be **imported** for use. A [module](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module) is a [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) written in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python). These [modules](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module) (individual [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) files) can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#package) and [libraries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#library). Depending on how many [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single [module](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module), a [package](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#package) of [modules](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module), or a whole [library](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#library).\n",

    "`import module_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from the \"Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks\" lesson, we imported the `time` [module](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module) and used the `sleep()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) to wait 5 seconds."

When we call the `share_number` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function), it prints the [local variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-variable) and the [global variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-variable). After the `share_number()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) completes we try to print both variables in a [global scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-scope). The program prints `global_secret_number` but crashes when trying to print `local_secret_number` in a [global scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice not to name a [local variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-variable) the same thing as a [global variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-variable). If we define a [variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable) with the same name in a [local scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-scope), it becomes a [local variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-variable) within that scope. Once the [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) is closed, the [global variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-variable) retains its original value."
