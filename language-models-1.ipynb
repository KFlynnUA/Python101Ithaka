If you load or use a language model that is too big, you may fill all of the available space (10 GB) and/or memory (8 GB) in your lab. If the memory is full, try restarting the kernel (or restarting the lab).

    "I really wanted to like this game as I enjoyed the first one on the switch. Problem is, tears is FAR more difficult than the original. It’s not a casual game at all anymore. It takes far too much time, effort, research (online) to figure out where to find hidden areas and there are lots of “stuck points” (dead ends) that have no way of getting out except going to previous game save.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "1. Beautiful graphics and environments\n",
    "2. Mending/Attaching, Ascending\n",
    "3. Dynamic loading of zones (developers should be commended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "1. The controls are lazy. The jump button is at the top, sprint is where jump should be. Attack is on opposite of where every other game is. It’s equivalent of having one App on an iPhone that doesn’t use basic swipe functionality. Quite frankly, it’s bad design\n",
    "2. The first Zelda showed what/where you’re supposed to do/get to in a shrine via a quick cut scene. This one does none of that. What’s worse, is that on the sky island, you’re actually given a new power and then if you leave (because the puzzle is obscenely hidden) - you don’t actually have the power. Puzzles are 10x’s harder. Example of nearly impossible puzzles use the rewind power (talk about next level difficulty: there’s a two clock handle gate puzzle that took me two days to get through. One puzzle!)\n",
    "3. Far more fighting/combat. Takes away the fun experience of exploring and talking to people doing side quests. And combat is just far more difficult in this game. The first robot shrine to train you, is just hard/horrible for a first tutorial.\n",
    "4. Sky island (first zone) is just overall at a ridiculously high level of difficulty. I got so disappointed (too much running around and end areas/or falling) that I abandoned the game for a few weeks and eventually came back. I had to watch several YouTube videos to figure out where the 4th shrine entrance was in a dark cave.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt2 = \"\"\"\n",
    "Where to begin with this game? Did you enjoy Breath of the Wild? Were you frustrated by certain aspects? If the answer was yes to both, you’ll love this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it’s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\n",
