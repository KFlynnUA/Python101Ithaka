    "\n",
    "Coming back to our example, we are using the **object** below to represent `house1`. Of course, depending on what properties/attributes and functions you want to include, you may represent `house1` with a different set of information stored in the **object**. In our scenario, we choose to use the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the price of the house and a function that calculates and prints out the price per square foot to represent `house1`. Let's assign this object to the variable name ```house1```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/intermediate_python_4_house1.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"300\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created another **object** representing `house2`. Let's assign the object to the variable name ```house2```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/intermediate_python_4_house2.png\" width=\"650\" height =\"300\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some terminologies. The variables in an object are called **attributes**. The functions in an object are called **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a look at the two objects we have created to represent `house1` and `house2` respectively, you can easily see that they are quite similar. They have the same set of **attributes**, i.e. number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, house price, number of square feet, and they have the same set of **methods**, i.e. a function that calculates and prints out the price per square foot. In other words, the two objects are written based on the same recipe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the objects are created based on the same recipe, it will be ideal if we can write out that recipe and then use it to produce the same kind of objects. In the house-buying scenario, for example, you will want as many objects as there are houses you are interested in! The question now becomes: how do we write that recipe? This is exactly where **classes** come in. "

For example, you may create a function which cleans the text (returns lowercase text, free from stopwords) in the preprocessing stage in a text analysis project. A few months later when you work on another project, you want to preprocess text in the same way as your previous project. In this case, you want to reuse the clean text method to clean the text in the same way as before.\n",
